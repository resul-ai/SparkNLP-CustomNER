A V/Q scan revealed multiple pulmonary perfusion defects consistent with high probability pulmonary embolism. A Doppler venous study of the lower extremity also revealed nonocclusive right popliteal vein thrombosis. A CT of the abdomen and pelvis revealed normal-appearing liver, spleen, and pancreas; however, the right kidney appeared smaller compared to left and suggesting possibility of renal infarct. Renal function on admission was within normal range; however, serial renal function showed rapid increase in creatinine to 5 today. He has been on intravenous heparin and hemodialysis is being planned for tomorrow. Reviewing his history, there is no family members with hypercoagulable state or prior history of any thrombotic complication. He denies any recent injury to his lower extremity and in fact denied any calf pain or swelling.\\nPAST MEDICAL AND SURGICAL HISTORY:\\nUnremarkable.\\nSOCIAL HISTORY:\\nHe is married and has 1 son. He has a brother who is healthy. There is no history of tobacco use or alcohol use.\\nFAMILY HISTORY:\\nNo family history of hypercoagulable condition.\\nMEDICATIONS:\\nAdvil p.r.n.\\nALLERGIES:\\nNONE.\\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS:\\nEssentially unremarkable except for sudden onset dyspnea on easy exertion complicated with episode of syncope. He denied any hemoptysis. He denied any calf swelling or pain. Lately, he has been traveling and has been sitting behind a desk for a long period of time.\\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION:\\nGENERAL: He is a robust young gentleman, awake, alert, and hemodynamically stable.\\nHEENT: Sclerae anicteric. Conjunctivae normal. Oropharynx normal.\\nNECK: No adenopathy or thyromegaly. No jugular venous distention.\\nHEART: Regular.\\nLUNGS: Bilateral air entry.\\nABDOMEN: Obese and benign.\\nEXTREMITIES: No calf swelling or calf tenderness appreciated.\\nSKIN: No petechiae or ecchymosis.\\nNEUROLOGIC: Nonfocal.\\nLABORATORY FINDINGS:\\nBlood count obtained showed a white count of 16.8, hemoglobin 14.8 g percent, hematocrit 44.6%, MCV 94, and platelet count 209,000. Liver profile normal. Thyroid study revealed a TSH of 1.3. Prothrombin time/INR 1.5, partial thromboplastin time 78.6 seconds. Renal function, BUN 44 and creatinine 5.7. Echocardiogram revealed left ventricular hypertrophy with ejection fraction of 65%, no intramural thrombus noted.\\nIMPRESSION:\\n1. Bilateral pulmonary embolism, most consistent with emboli from right lower extremity, on intravenous heparin, rule out hereditary hypercoagulable state.\\n2. Leukocytosis, most likely leukemoid reaction secondary to acute pulmonary embolism/renal infarction, doubt presence of myeloproliferative disorder.\\n3. Acute renal failure secondary to embolic right renal infarction.\\n4. Obesity.\\nPLAN:\\nFrom hematologic standpoint, we will await hypercoagulable studies, which have all been sent on admission to see if a hereditary component is at play. For now, we will continue intravenous heparin and subsequent oral anticoagulation with Coumadin. In view of worsening renal function, may need temporary hemodialysis until renal function improves. I discussed at length with the patient's wife at the bedside.\\nKeywords:\\nhematology - oncology, thrombosis, heparin, leukemoid, pulmonary embolism, renal function, intravenous, leukocytosis, venous, hypercoagulable, embolism, function, hematology,\",\n          \"Sample Type / Medical Specialty:\\nHematology - Oncology\\nSample Name:\\nNeck Mass Biopsy\\nDescription:\\nMalignant mass of the left neck, squamous cell carcinoma. Left neck mass biopsy and selective surgical neck dissection, left.\\n(Medical Transcription Sample Report)\\nPREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:\\nMalignant mass of the left neck.\\nPOSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:\\nMalignant mass of the left neck, squamous cell carcinoma.\\nPROCEDURES\\n1. Left neck mass biopsy.\\n2. Selective surgical neck dissection, left.\\nDESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:\\nAfter obtaining an informed, the patient was taken to the operating room where a time-out process was followed. Preoperative antibiotic was given and Dr. X proceeded to intubate the patient after a detailed anesthetic preparation that started in the Same Day Surgery and followed in the operating room. Finally, a 5.5-French endotracheal tube was inserted and the patient was able to tolerate that and did have stable vital signs and a proper oxygenation.\\nThen, the patient was positioned with the neck slightly distended and turned toward the opposite side of the operation. The neck was prepped and draped in the usual fashion. I proceeded to mark the site of the mass and then also to mark the proposed site for the creation of a flap. Then, I performed an extensive anesthetic block of the area.\\nThen, an incision was made along the area marked for development of the flap, but in a very limited extent, just to expose the cervical mass. The cervical mass, which was about 4 cm in diameter and very firm and rubbery, was found lodged between the sternocleidomastoid muscle and the internal jugular vein in the area III of the neck. A wedge sample was sent to Pathology for frozen section. At the same time, we waited for the result and the initial report was not clear in the sense that a lot of lymphoepithelial reaction was seen. Therefore, a larger sample was sent to Pathology and at that particular time, the fresh frozen was reported as having squamous elements. This was not totally clear in my mind and therefore I proceeded to excise the full mass, which luckily was not attached to any structures except in the very deep surface. There, there were some attachments to branches of the external carotid artery, which had to be suture ligated. At any rate, the whole specimen was to the lab and finally the diagnosis was that of a metastatic squamous cell carcinoma.\\nWith that information in hand, we proceeded to continue with a neck dissection and proceeded to make an incision along the previously marked sites of the flap, which basically involved a reverse U shape on the left neck. This worked out quite nicely. The external jugular vein was out of the way, so initially we did not deal with it. We proceeded to tackle the area III and extended into II-A. When we excised the mass, the upper end was in intimate relationship with the parotid gland, which was relatively large in this patient, but it looked normal otherwise. Also, I felt that the submaxillary gland was enlarged. At any rate, we decided to clean up the areas III and IV and a few nodes from II-A that were removed, and then we went into the posterior triangle where we identified the spinal accessory nerve, which we protected, actually did not even dissect close to it.\\nThe same nerve had been already identified anterior to the internal jugular vein, very proximally behind the digastric and the sternocleidomastoid muscle. At any rate, there were large nodes in the posterior triangle, in areas V-A and V-B, which were excised and sent to Pathology for examination. Also, there was a remnant of a capsule of the main mass that we proceeded to excise and sent to Pathology as an extra specimen. Hemostasis was revised and found to be adequate. The flaps had been protected by folding it to the chest and protected by wet sponges on both sides of the flap. The flap was replaced in its position. A soft Jackson-Pratt catheter was left in the area, and then we proceeded to approximate the flap with a number of subcutaneous sutures of Vicryl and then running sutures of subcuticular Monocryl to the skin. I would like to mention that also the facial vein was excised and the external jugular vein was ligated. It was in very lateral location and it was on the site of the drain, so we ligated that but did not excise it. A pressure dressing was applied.\\nThe patient tolerated the procedure well. Estimated blood loss was no more than 100 mL. The patient was extubated in the operating room and sent for recovery.\\nKeywords:\\nhematology - oncology, neck mass biopsy, surgical neck dissection, internal jugular vein, external jugular vein, squamous cell carcinoma, neck mass, malignant mass, neck dissection, mass, neck, wedge, vein,\",\n          \"Sample Type / Medical Specialty:\\nHematology - Oncology\\nSample Name:\\nDischarge Summary - Mesothelioma\\nDescription:\\nA patient with preoperative diagnosis of right pleural mass and postoperative diagnosis of mesothelioma.\\n(Medical Transcription Sample Report)\\nPREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:\\nRight pleural mass.\\nPOSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:\\nMesothelioma.\\nPROCEDURES PERFORMED:\\n1.
